## Description

This web application is a simple calculator built with React, showcasing the use of state management through `useReducer`, component composition, and event handling. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project serves as a practical example for learning React concepts and state management.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic calculations.
- Real-time display of the input and result.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Clear button to reset the calculator.

## Technologies Used

- React: Used to build the user interface and manage state.
- `useReducer`: Used for state management.
- Component composition: Organizes UI components efficiently.
- Event handling: Manages user interactions for calculations.
